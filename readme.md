## ⏱️ Complexity Recognition Patterns

| Pattern                    | Time Complexity |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Single loop                | O(n)            |
| Nested loops               | O(n²)           |
| Binary search              | O(log n)        |
| Divide by 2 recursion      | O(log n)        |
| Merge sort                 | O(n log n)      |

---

## 🎯 Interview Conventions (Important)

### Hash Table Operations

> Average Case: O(1)
> Worst Case: O(n)


### Key Reminders
- Subarrays / substrings → `n(n + 1) / 2`
- Pairs → `n(n − 1) / 2`
- Balanced trees → `log n`
- Power of two → `n & (n − 1)`

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- Interviewers expect **recognition**, not derivation
- Use formulas to **justify complexity**
- Always explain **why a formula applies**

This README contains **all the math you need** for MAANG DSA interviews — nothing more, nothing less.
